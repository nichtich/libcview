See http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Treemap/example2.html for an
example with on-demand nodes. We should only show up to three levels.

The Sunbirst view should be sorted by notation and on highlighting 
better show rays of subclasses.

Add Icicle Tree:

- http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Icicle/example2.html

Add SpaceTree
- http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example1.html
- http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example2.html

This can also include removing of subtrees 
(for hiding parts of the classification)
- http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example3.html

We could implement a SpaceTree with nodes as pie diagrams, as shown in
- http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Other/example3.html
For instance this could show the percentage of books on hold etc.

RGraph and HyperTree may also be of interest later.
